# calculator
This project is a straightforward calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean and intuitive interface where users can input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator's display screen shows the input and output, and users can clear the screen with the "C" button. Upon pressing the "=" button, the calculator evaluates the entered expression using JavaScript's eval() function and displays the result. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to web development and JavaScript programming, offering a practical example of creating interactive functionality within a web page.
